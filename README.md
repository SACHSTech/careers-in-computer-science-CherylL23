**Competition:**

*Canadian engineering competition*

Each year, the Canadian Engineering Competition (CEC) brings together over 200 of the most innovative and creative engineering undergraduate students from across the nation to compete against each other in eight categories (Junior Design, Senior Design, Innovative Design, Engineering Consulting, Parliamentary Debate, Re-engineering, Programming, and Engineering Communication). Each competition category at CEC challenges its participants to expand their frame of reference and to identify solutions to problems experienced by our profession. Established in 1985, and hosted yearly at a constituent school, CEC is a highly selective competition. Those invited must first best their peers at their own intra-school competition, and then must achieve a top performance at their respective regional competition.

*Experience*
The competition represents a valuable opportunity for industry participation and support, and sponsors and contributors propose real-world case studies for competition themes. The judges are drawn from related industry fields, or academia, and share their experiences with the competitors throughout the weekend as they network with the top up-and-coming engineers.
