# Careers in Computer Science
## **The Basics**
### Systems Engineer
It is a type of software developer. They create and implement programs for backend processing systems. Organizations and companies hire these developers and mostly work behind the scenes. An example of a program is a bank website. The average salary in Canada is $83465 per year.

**Responsibilities:**
* Use tools to write and test codes in order to find any bugs 
* Create solutions and fixes the program
* Discuss with clients and propose solutions with other developers 

**Required education:** You need a bachelor's degree related to computer science or software development

**Technical and non technical skills:**

*Nontechnical skills*

Communication - must consistently respond to clients and be able to socialize with your team of developers

Time management - there will be multiple projects to juggle. Must have a strong work effort and be reliable

Creativity - when creating ways to deal with bugs, it is better to find a efficient and innovative way to handle it with your team

*Technical skills*
* Know how to code using the development tools
* Strong knowledge of computer engineering and general software development
